============ Old plans
_Version 0.1_:

 - Full document parsing. Full asynchronous `Add/Cancel` protocol.

 - **[started]** Implement Locate -> "file name where the object is defined".
   To improve.

 - Improve the handling of names and environments, see
   `Coq.Init.Notations.instantiate` vs `instantiate`, the issue of `Nametab.shortest_qualid_of_global` is a very sensible one for IDEs

   Maybe we could add some options `Short`, `Full`, `Best` ? ...
   Or we could even serialize the naming structure and let the ide decide if we export the current open namespace.

 - Help with complex codepaths:
   Load Path parsing and completion code is probably one of the most complex part of company-coq

_Version 0.2_:

 - Redo Query API, make objects tagged with a GADT.
   *Critical: we hope to have gained enough experience to introduce the object tag*

_More_:

 - Support regexps in queries.
 - Would be easy to get a list of vernacs? Things like `Print`, `Typeclasses eauto`, etc.
 - ppx to enumerate datatypes. Write the help command with this and also Cl√©ment suggestions about Vernac enumeration.
 - Add a cache to full document parsing..
 - enable an open CoqObject tag for plugin use (see coq/coq#209 ) ?
 - Checkstyle support.

=============================

_Version 0.4_:

 * support Coq 8.7 , make use of improved upstream API,
 * support serialization of generic arguments [#41],
 * full file support hack

_Version 0.2_:

 * Better Query/Object system.

_Version 0.1_:

 * Serialization-independent protocol core,
 * [js] Javascript worker,
 * [lib] Better Prelude support,
 * [serlib] Full Serialization of generic arguments,
 * [proto] Add is not a synchronous call anymore,
 * [proto] Refactor into a flat command hierarchy,
 * [proto] More useful queries,
 * [proto] Guarantee initial state is 1,
 * [proto] Support for ltac profiling,
 * [proto] Printing: add depth limiting,
 * [proto] Better handling of options in the sexp backend.

_Version 0.03_:

 * **[done]** Implicit arguments.
 * **[done]** Coq Workers support.
 * **[done]** Advanced Sentence splitting `(Parse (Sentence string))`, which can handle the whole document.

_Version 0.02_:

 * **[done]** Serialization of the `Proof.proof` object.
 * **[done]** Improve API: add options.
 * **[done]** Improve and review printing workflow.
 * **[done]** `(Query ((Prefix "add") (Limit 10) (PpStr)) $ObjectType)`
 * **[done]** Basic Sentence splitting `(Parse num string))`, retuns the first num end of the sentences _without_ executing them.
              This has pitfalls as parsing is very stateful.
 * **[done]** Basic completion-oriented Search support `(Query () Names)`
 * **[done]** Better command line parsing (`Cmdliner`, `Core` ?)
 * **[partial]** Print Grammar tactic. `(Query ... (Tactics))`.
   Still we need to decide on:
   `Coq.Init.Notations.instantiate` vs `instantiate`, the issue of
   `Nametab.shortest_qualid_of_global` is a very sensible one for IDEs
